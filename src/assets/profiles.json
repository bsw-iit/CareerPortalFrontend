CV shortlisting is by far the biggest bottleneck, where ~50 unique students are shortlisted from a pool of 500+ applicants. As such, preparing a standout CV is crucial. Begin working on your CV early to allow sufficient time for refinement and development. Your CV should tell a compelling story about your achievements and experiences.</span></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"font-size: 22px; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px; font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;\">\n    <div><p style=\"font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold; display: inline;\">Building Your CV:</p> <span>A consulting CV typically comprises five sections: CG, Scholastic Achievements, Internships, PORs, and ECAs. A consulting CV is judged via the ‘spike’ framework. A ‘spike’ section is one where you’re well above the average applicant. It is the section that stands out to the person evaluating your CV. Although there is some subjectivity to what you call a spike, being well above average in atleast 3-4 sections is non-negotiable for a shortlist among the top firms.</span></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"font-size: 22px; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px; font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;\">\n    <div><p style=\"font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold; display: inline;\">CG:</p> <span> <ul style=\"margin-left: 30px; list-style-type: disc;\"> <li>Generally top firms consider CG above 8 to be satisfactory, some firms have also put hard barriers in the past. A CG above 8.5 or 9 is an ideal spike.</li><li> A lower CG makes getting shortlisted tougher but can be compensated by excelling in other sections. (Note: These numbers are subject to the relative performance of the applicants in a particular batch)</li></ul></span></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"font-size: 22px; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px; font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;\">\n    <div><p style=\"font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold; display: inline;\">Schols:</p> <span> <ul style=\"margin-left: 30px; list-style-type: disc;\"> <li>This section includes institute-level awards such as Merit List, Department Rank, and pre-institute achievements like Olympiad ranks or scholarships.</li><li> If this section of yours is lacking, don’t worry, with some conscious effort you can build your section up to a satisfactory level.</li></ul></span></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"font-size: 22px; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px; font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;\">\n    <div><p style=\"font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold; display: inline;\">Internships:</p> <span><ul style=\"margin-left: 30px; list-style-type: disc;\"> <li>These include corporate, start-up and research interns (offline/online). It is highly advised to complete multiple internships. Internships in big brand corporations or business schools are valued.</li><li> An offline intern at a well-established corporate (even more impactful if it is in the consulting sector) or at a foreign research institute are considered as particularly great options. These can be coupled with a remote intern at a business school, which is usually a significantly less time commitment.</li></ul></span></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"font-size: 22px; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px; font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;\">\n    <div><p style=\"font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold; display: inline;\">PORs:</p> <span><ul style=\"margin-left: 30px; list-style-type: disc;\"> <li>This section conveys the story of your campus involvements over the course of two years. Continuity in POR’s is hence valued, indicating progress in whatever activity you’ve devoted time to.</li><li> 3rd year POR’s are important. Elected POR’s are generally considered more valuable than nominated POR’s.</li></ul></span></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"font-size: 22px; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px; font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;\">\n    <div><p style=\"font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold; display: inline;\">ECAs:</p> <span><ul style=\"margin-left: 30px; list-style-type: disc;\"> <li>Organize your ECAs into 2-3 broad sections to provide structure. Having multiple ECA’s in a few select sections shows excellence and dedication as opposed to having them scattered across various sections.</li><li> Ensure that the most valuable achievements are presented well to make your CV stand out.</li></ul></span></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"font-size: 22px; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px; font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;\">\n    <div><p style=\"font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold; display: inline;\">Buddy Rounds:</p> <span>Once you are shortlisted, the firm will allot you buddies. A buddy is a consultant working at the firm and is usually an alum of the institute. Buddies will conduct case solving sessions with you, guiding you through your preparation. These sessions are evaluative, with firms using them to create a “hotlist” of preferred candidates. Although not being on the hotlist does not eliminate your chances, performing well in these rounds increases your likelihood of being prioritized.</span></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"font-size: 22px; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px; font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;\">\n    <div><p style=\"font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold; display: inline;\">Case Prep:</p> <span><ul style=\"margin-left: 30px; list-style-type: disc;\"> <li><strong>Form a Case Group:</strong> Work with 3-4 serious aspirants who have diverse networks. This allows you to access varied insights and resources. Case groups help maintain regular practice but also seek opportunities to practice with seniors and peers outside your group.</li><li> You can start practicing cases 1-2 months before your interviews ensuring you’re at your peak during the interviews and senior buddy cases. Start with guesstimates and profitability, while aiming to cover other types of cases towards the end of your prep.</li><li> Practice in pairs, taking turns as interviewer and interviewee. After each case, spend time analyzing your performance and building a deeper understanding of frameworks and solutions.</li></ul></span></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"font-size: 22px; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px; font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;\">\n    <div><p style=\"font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold; display: inline;\">Resources:</p> <span> <ul style=\"margin-left: 30px; list-style-type: disc;\"> <li>A conventionally followed method to begin is getting an overview of case preps via the recorded lectures of Victor Cheng and Case Interviews Cracked: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRfC6rXAvJzcp_bkNMbbMgRm0gER0fbr2\" style=\"color: blue; text-decoration: underline;\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube Playlist</a> (stick to the first few relevant lectures)</li></ul>\n   <li>Case Compendium (a good beginner-friendly option), Case Interviews Cracked and IIM Ahmedabad Case Book (slightly more advanced than the former) are some conventional case books used by applicants. <a href=\"https://owncloud.iitd.ac.in/nextcloud/index.php/s/q97gkNsXzyC5wik?dir=undefined&openfile=12489832\" style=\"color: blue; text-decoration: underline;\" target=\"_blank\">Download here</a></li></ul></span></div>\n</div>"
