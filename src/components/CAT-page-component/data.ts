  "Key challenges": [
    "Score fluctuations across passages; progress can feel hard to track.",
  ],
  "Preparation focus": [
    "Emphasize process over marks until August/September.",
    "Build reading ability (speed + comprehension) and critical thinking.",
  ],
  "Why Reading Comprehension dominates": [
    "Reading Comprehension covers roughly 70–80% of this section; mastering it also helps with para summary, para completion, para jumbles, and fill‑in‑the‑blanks.",
  ],
  "Strategies for reading ability": [
    "Read diverse materials: The Hindu editorials (language/style), The Economist (global context), Aeon essays (denser prose).",
    "Paraphrase each paragraph in one sentence to lock in the main idea.",
    "Prefer articles over books for exposure to varied writing styles.",
  ],
  "Question strategies": [
    "General/main‑idea: Use your paragraph summaries without revisiting the passage.",
    "Specific‑detail: Refer back to the exact lines.",
    "Interpretation/strengthen/weaken: Analyze options against the passage’s central idea; revisit only if needed.",
  ],
  "Key techniques": [
    "Skimming for structure, then revisit for details.",
    "Eliminate wrong options (extreme words, out‑of‑scope additions, distortions).",
    "Vocabulary: learn meanings in context while reading; dedicated vocab memorization is not necessary.",
  ],
  Resources: [
    "Books: RC 99, Manhattan GMAT Reading Comprehension",
    "Online: Newspapers, magazines, GMATClub threads, previous year questions, and mock explanations",
    "Mocks/sectionals: Crucial from August onward for practice and benchmarking",

export const DILR = {
  "Key challenges": [
    "Highly unpredictable set styles and difficulty; progress can vary.",
    "Time management is critical.",
  ],
  "What the section typically looks like": [
    "20–22 questions in 40 minutes, arranged as 4–5 sets of 4–6 questions each.",
    "Expected mix: Data Interpretation ~8–10 and Logical Reasoning ~10–12; mixed DI–LR sets are common.",
  ],
  "Preparation focus": [
    "Set selection decides your score.",
    "Build analytical thinking (tables/graphs/charts/caselets) and logical reasoning (seating arrangements, grid puzzles, tournaments, Venn diagrams).",
    "Improve calculation speed; prioritize accuracy first, then speed.",
  ],
  Strategies: [
    "Spend 3–5 minutes scanning all sets at the start.",
    "Aim to solve 2–3 clean sets with ~95% accuracy (often enough for 95th percentile+).",
    "Practice recognizing solvable sets within 10–12 minutes.",
  ],
  "Solving approach": [
    "Logical Reasoning: Draw grids/diagrams; start with the most restrictive constraints.",
    "Data Interpretation: Identify trends/ratios first; compute only what is necessary.",
    "Use elimination when options contradict constraints or data trends.",
  ],
  "Speed boosters": [
    "Approximations; fraction–percentage pairs (e.g., 1/6 = 16.67%); multiplication tables up to 20; squares and cubes up to 40; regular mental‑math sprints.",
  ],
  "Recommended resources": [
    "Books: Arun Sharma (DI & LR), Nishit K. Sinha, R. S. Aggarwal",
    "Online: Previous year papers (last 5 years; ~75 strong sets), free practice on 2IIM, Cracku, Quantifiers; business news graphics for data sense",
  ],
  "Additional tips": [
    "Daily practice: 3–4 hours, including 5 weekly sittings of 1 hour each.",
    "Avoid the sunk‑cost trap—if a set stalls beyond 13–14 minutes, move on.",
  ],
};

export const QA = {
  "Key challenges": [
    "Broad conceptual range; time pressure; application‑heavy questions; fluctuating difficulty.",
  ],
  "Preparation focus": [
    "Build fundamentals; develop speed with accuracy; learn shortcuts and option elimination; prioritize high‑weight topics.",
  ],
  "Typical topic weight": [
    "Arithmetic (8–10): Percentages; profit & loss; simple/compound interest; ratio & proportion; time & work; time–speed–distance; averages; mixtures & alligation",
    "Algebra (6–8): Linear/quadratic equations; inequalities; functions; progressions; logarithms",
    "Geometry & Mensuration (3–5): Triangles; circles; coordinate geometry; 3D geometry; areas; volumes",
    "Number Systems (2–4): Factors; multiples; divisibility; remainders; LCM/HCF; indices; surds",
    "Modern Math (1–3): Permutations & combinations; probability; set theory",
  ],
  "Study routine": [
    "Revisit basics (NCERT 8–10 or CAT‑specific texts).",
    "Focus one topic per week; solve 20–30 questions per day (easy → medium → hard) and finish with a few Type In The Answer problems.",
    "Maintain a mistake log (concept gap / misread / speed / carelessness).",
  ],
  "Time management": [
    "Easier questions in 1–1.5 minutes; tougher ones in 2–3 minutes.",
    "In mocks, prioritize arithmetic and algebra; target 14–16 attempts with ~95% accuracy for a strong score.",
    "Type In The Answer questions (~6–8 per section): no negative marking—accuracy matters.",
  ],
  Resources: [
    "Books: Arun Sharma (laddered difficulty), Nishit K. Sinha (concept depth), R. S. Aggarwal (foundational practice)",
    "Online: Previous year questions (last 5–7 years), free tests on 2IIM, Career Launcher, Hitbullseye; YouTube channels (Rodha, 2IIM)",
  ],
  "Additional tips": [
    "Daily practice: 3–4 hours, with 5–6 weekly sittings of 1 hour each.",
    "Analyze mocks; track topic‑wise accuracy; practice mental math; avoid overcomplicating straightforward questions.",
  ],
